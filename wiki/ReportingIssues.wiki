*Reporting Issues with the Google SAML Bridge for Windows*

For customers who qualify for enterprise-level support, Google
provides support for the Google SAML Bridge for Windows when used with
a Google Search Appliance. You can
go to [http://www.google.com/support/enterprise/go/gsa_support] for
instructions on how to contact Google Enterprise Support.

For unsupported issues, such as using the SAML bridge without a Google Search
Appliance, working with the source code, or to report problems with
unsupported development builds, you can 
[http://code.google.com/p/google-saml-bridge-for-windows/issues/list file an issue]
on this code site. Google may not respond to every issue.
